        "\n",
        "1.  **Galton Box Circuit:** The search results for \"quantum galton box circuit\" confirm the basic circuit structure involves Hadamard gates and controlled-NOT gates to simulate the coin flips and movement. I'll create a function that takes the number of layers to build this circuit. The use of Qiskit's `Sampler` primitive is the modern way to get a noiseless distribution, and I will include that in the code example.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Different Distributions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "      * **Exponential Distribution:** The search results point to methods for encoding probability distributions, often using amplitude encoding. The `NormalDistribution` class from `qiskit.circuit.library` is an example of this. I will explain that for an exponential distribution, a custom circuit would be needed to prepare a state where the amplitudes correspond to the square root of the target exponential probabilities.\n",
        "      * **Hadamard Quantum Walk:** The search results provide a detailed explanation of a quantum walk circuit. It involves a \"coin\" qubit (with a Hadamard gate) and a \"position\" register. The key is the controlled shift operator that moves the walker's position based on the coin's state. I will design a function that builds this circuit for a given number of steps (layers).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Optimization with Noise:** The search results on \"qiskit fake providers\" and \"noise model\" are highly relevant. They show how to use `qiskit.providers.fake_provider` to get a `FakeBackend` with a built-in noise model. They also emphasize the importance of **transpiling** the circuit for that specific backend to ensure the gates are correct and to apply the noise model properly. I will outline a strategy for optimization that includes choosing a suitable fake backend, transpiling with a high optimization level, and discussing potential error mitigation techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Distance Calculation:** The search results suggest several metrics for comparing distributions, such as **Hellinger distance**, and also mention the **SWAP test** for state similarity. I will focus on a classical metric like the **Total Variation Distance (TVD)** or **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence**, as they are straightforward to compute from the output histograms and are standard for comparing probability distributions. I will provide a Python function to compute the TVD and explain how to account for uncertainty by performing multiple runs and calculating statistical properties of the distances.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have all the necessary information to construct a detailed, correct, and well-structured response. I will use code examples for each part to make the instructions clear. I'll use the `Sampler` primitive for noiseless simulations and the `AerSimulator` with a noise model for the noisy simulations, as this aligns with current Qiskit practices.\n",
